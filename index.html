	     <h1> CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years Director Demands Investigation  </h1>

	      <h2>  Adapted from The Onion </h2>

	       <p>   LANGLEY, VA - A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.  <br> <br>

	       According to the report, sections of the documents - "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947. <br> <br>
     

	   CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 


           <ul>
           	<li>the Cold War</li>
           	<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
           	<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
           </ul>
